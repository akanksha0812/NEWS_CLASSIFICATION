# NEWS_CLASSIFICATION

This project involves classifying news articles into predefined categories based on their content. This task is typically in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.
The project entails defining categories, gathering, and preprocessing labeled news data, selecting and training a machine learning model (like SVM, Naive Bayes, or Deep Learning), and evaluating its performance. After fine-tuning for optimal results, the model is deployed for real-time news categorization. Continuous monitoring and updates are needed to maintain accuracy as news trends evolve. Ethical considerations are crucial, such as avoiding bias in data and outcomes. The project ultimately automates the categorization of news articles into predefined classes based on their content, utilizing techniques from natural language processing and machine learning.
